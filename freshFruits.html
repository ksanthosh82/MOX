					<!-- Bootstrap carousel usage
						Bootstrap carousel should have id. Below i am using "bs-carousel-X". Where "X" denotes number". If a page has more than 1 carousel, then add the new carousel with the id "bs-carousel-1", "bs-carousel-2". You also need to update the id in, "carousel indicators" section and "carousel control" section.

						Carousel comes with 3 main data attributes which you can customize. They are...
						data-interval - Time delay between item cycle. Default value "5000".
						data-pause - Pause on hover. Default value "pause".
						data-wrap - Continues cycle or stop at the end. Default value "true".
